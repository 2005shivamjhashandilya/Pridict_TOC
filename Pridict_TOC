Predict_TOC
The project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content in shale gas reservoirs. Traditionally, TOC has been assessed through laboratory methods, such as core analysis, which can be limited in providing continuous high-resolution information. The project seeks to leverage continuous well log data to overcome these limitations and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of source rock properties. Methodology: The project employs a comprehensive methodology for predictive modeling:

Data Cleaning and Scaling: Ensuring the quality and consistency of well log data.
Data Analysis: Thorough analysis of well log data to identify patterns and correlations.
Train Test Split: Division of the dataset into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.
Developing the Model: Implementation of a predictive model, with a focus on Random Forest regression.
Obtaining Assessment Metrics: Evaluation of model performance using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
Parameters Analysis In-depth analysis of parameters influencing the predictive model.
Comparison of Results: Comparative assessment of different regression models.
The project concludes that the Random Forest regressor is the best-fit model for predicting TOC values, achieving a minimal Root Mean Square Error of 0.0644.
